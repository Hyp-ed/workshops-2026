# Workshops 2025

_Used for all Software Team workshops in the 2024/25 academic year._

Hello 👋! This repository contains some workshops to complete as part of onboarding onto the Software team.

## Workshops

### 1. Git and GitHub

The first workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/workshops-2025/tree/main/01-git).

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to `git` and GitHub, or as a quick refresher for those who are already familiar. It takes you through the basics of git, creating your own branches, opening up a PR on this repository and resolving merge conflicts.

### 2. Introduction to Embassy

The second workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/workshops-2025/tree/main/02-intro_to_embassy).

This workshops introduces [Embassy](https://embassy.dev/) by walking through how to run a simple blinky lights program on an STM32L476 board.

_Between workshops 1 and 2 you are expected to have started learning Rust_ (the workshop task for this is to work through [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). See our Wiki page "[Rust Resources](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/hyped-2025/wiki/Rust-Resources)" for a list of good resources to use for learning Rust.

### 3. Sensors Workshop - I2C Temperature Sensor

The third workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/workshops-2025/tree/main/03-i2c_temp_sensor).

This workshop is primarily for members of the Sensors subteam, but is probably useful for other teams too. It walks you through implementing an I2C temperature sensor for the STM32L476 board by providing a skeleton of the code with sections missing for you to fill in.
